    x=y;     // calling function.
    y=temp;
    printf("swap function:%d %d\n",x,y);

   int a=10;
   int b=20;
   printf("before swap:%d %d\n",a,b);// calling function.

}

call by value:
1)the call by value the change are made in the fuction (called).
2)and if we want to change the value in the calling it can not change only main function it can be change the value.
3)after the calling function completes the execution in the calling function will destroyed in the stack that is the we did not get the value in the calling function.
